#### Scene

This scene, inspired by the [Persona Game Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)) unfolds within a tranquil blue room ("Persona Velvet Room"). The focal point is a table situated in the middle, adorned with various items such as a box, frames, a clock, candles providing subtle illumination, a plate with a cake on it, an open newspaper, and a spring.

Behind the table, we can see a pot containing a sunflower, adding a touch of nature to the scene. On the walls there are two frames with a photograph of both students who made this scene and the other displaying a drawing of a beetle. The unmistakable game clock serves mainly for aesthetic purposes, contributing to the distinctive thematic essence inspired by the Persona Game Series.

This curated scene invites viewers to immerse themselves in its atmosphere, where every element contributes to a unique blend of familiarity and thematic resonance.
